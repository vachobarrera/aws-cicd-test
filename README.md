# Important considerations:
1. The current repository contains the code taken from the public repository [timeoff-management-application](https://github.com/timeoff-management/timeoff-management-application).
2. The Dockerfile was modified in order to install python3 and sqlite.
3. The current proposal contains 2 ways to deploy the app and the nedded infrastructure due my interest on testing the app with and without the Dockerfile.

# Proposal
